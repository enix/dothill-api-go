A Go implementation of the [Dothill API](https://www.seagate.com/files/dothill-content/support/documentation/AssuredSAN_4004_Series_CLI_Reference_Guide_GL105.pdf).

## Run tests using our mock server

In order to run tests, you will need to start a mock server by running `go run cmd/mock/mock.go`. It will expose the mocked api on `localhost:8080`.

You're now ready to go, just run `go test -v` to run the tests suite.

You can also run tests with docker-compose, using this command, which is the one used in the CI:

```sh
docker-compose up --build --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from tests
```

Both the mocked api and the tests use as username and passwords variables from the environment, or from the `.env` file if missing. Since the `.env` file is pre-filled, you should not have to add any environment variable in order to make the tests work.

## Test using a live system

This option runs the golang test cases against a live storage system. Two steps are required:

- Update .env with the correct system IP address and credentials
- Run `go test -v`

Another option is to define environment variables, which take precedence over .env values

```bash
export TEST_STORAGEIP=http://<ipaddress>
export TEST_USERNAME=<username>
export TEST_PASSWORD=<password>
go test -v
unset TEST_STORAGEIP TEST_PASSWORD TEST_USERNAME
```
